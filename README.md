This is Computational Biology Course project that I work with my fellow two group mates. The codes that are used in the projects were not self-made and were taken from Kaggle. They have been changed and modified to our likings and modified to how we want to use them in the project.

### **Summary of Background**

This project aims to assist Indonesian farmers in identifying plant diseases early, a key factor in preventing crop failures that are common in the region. Manual identification is time-consuming and requires specialized knowledge, so the project utilizes machine learning algorithms, particularly image classification, to detect disease patterns on leaves quickly and efficiently. By improving disease detection, the project seeks to enhance agricultural productivity and support Indonesia's economic growth, ultimately helping farmers meet their food needs more effectively.

### Dataset

New Plant Diseases Dataset created by Samir Bhattarai is the dataset that is used in three state or art method coding (CNN, GoogleNet, VGG16). It was created in 2018 which can be accessed through https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vipoooool/new-plant-diseases-dataset. The dataset was recreated using offline augmentation from the original PlantVillage dataset by spMohanty on github repository that consisted of 87 thousand healthy and diseased leaves images which was categorized into 38 classes.

### Purpose & Benefits

The aim of this project is so that Indonesian farmers can identify plant diseases quickly so that they can minimize the occurrence of crop failures. The project will use a CNN (Convolutional Neural Network) architecture with 3 methods whose evaluation metrics are targeted, as follows:

F-1 Score : 80%

Accuracy : 80%

Precision : 80%

### Languange and Tools

We use Google Colab for using programming Python, particularly for machine learning, data science, and education. It offers free access to powerful GPUs and TPUs, allowing users to train models in minutes or seconds. The web-based interface is intuitive and user-friendly, and multiple users can work on the same notebook simultaneously. Colab notebooks support markdown, making it easier to document work and communicate ideas. It comes pre-installed with popular libraries and tools for machine learning and deep learning, such as TensorFlow, Keras, NumPy, Pandas, seaborn, matplotlib, Keras, and others, to save time and eliminating the need to manually install and configure these tools.

P.S. The author (Sadik Al Jarif) of GoogleNet code that I originally used seems to have his account inactive. So, I provide another alternative Kaggle link, kinda similar to the original one.

P.S.S. The code given might not reflecting to how we want the result wanted to be.
